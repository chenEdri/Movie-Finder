# MyMovies

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli), based on [omdbapi](https://www.omdbapi.com/) and [Angular-Material](https://material.angular.io/)
 
## Development server

### option 1:
Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### option 2:
go to my [git-hub page](https://chenedri.github.io/Movie-Finder/)

## Api Astrategy:
there are two options of 'GET' :  or by movie Title.
### Movie Title: 
Will get a small object with five fields.
In this app I used other optional requests in the params such as:'Year' , 'Type' and 'Plot'.
### IMDBID:
widll get a big object with more than 12 fields.
I used this method in order to get a larger detailed object from the api.

## Angular-Material:
I used angular material in order to practice another libary that has a lot of options in it. 
In this app I used the FieldModule, DialogModule, CustomMatTheme and more.
